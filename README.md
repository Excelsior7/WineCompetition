### Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 5 : Tabular Ordinal Regression with a Wine Quality Dataset

Kaggle is a well-known site in the Data Science community. After a while of looking at the different features of this site from afar, I decided to get involved in a competition. Since I'm coming from a several weeks excursion from the NLP world I've been working a lot with unstructured textual data and Deep Learning architectures. 
Because of this, I wanted the competition to be focused around a tool that I think remains central to the data scientist: tabular data. For this, Kaggle and their **Kaggle's Playground Series** competitions were just perfect: well crafted competitions that last around two weeks with competitors who are often very resourceful.

So, the competition that was going on at the time I was looking for one was a competition that consisted of predicting the quality of a wine, ranging from the lowest quality 3 to the best quality 8, using some of its physicochemical information. To be precise, 11 physicochemical explanatory variables are provided, such as the acidity level or the sugar content.

The wines from which the dataset was constituted are red and white wines of the Portuguese wine [Vinho Verde](https://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/). The original source of this dataset is attributed to [Paulo Cortez](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez), University of Minho, Guimar√£es, Portugal.

For this first Kaggle competition, I obtained a Quadratic Cohen Kappa Score of 0.59235 which gives me the 9th place on 901, approximately top 0.9% in the Kaggle leaderboard.
